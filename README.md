# Week-2
In Week 2 of my Power BI internship, I need to create 10 problem statements using the given dataset, which includes columns like Area, Crop Year, Crop Name, District Name, Production, Season, and State Name. I will then visualize these problem statements in Report View to analyze trends and insights in crop production.
